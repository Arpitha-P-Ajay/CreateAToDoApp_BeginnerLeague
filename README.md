### Beginner's League

# Challenge - Create a To-do App
Build a basic To-Do List App that lets users add, check off, and delete tasks. This is a great way to practice how apps work using code! You can keep it simple or try adding your own twist. You can use any language of your choice.

Languages used - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Extra supports 
- CDN library (for font Jost) :  https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome
- Icons (just the '+' icon for adding tasks):  https://fontawesome.com/
- Confetti animations (used in task completion) :  https://confetti.js.org/more.html

Learned from Youtube to store the file data

The WOW factor here is that the tasks will still remain even if you refresh the page. Also there is a progress bar that let you know the number of completed tasks from total tasks.
And also you can edit the tasks before completion. It is Responsive
